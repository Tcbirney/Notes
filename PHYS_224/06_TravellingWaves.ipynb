    "A disturbance travels or propegates with a definite velocity and are controlled by the mechanical properties of the medium. For a taut string, these are the mass per unit length and the tension in the string. __The medium does not travel with the wave__. The particle move about the equilibrium positions which they are bound to. These can be viewed as a long line of coupled oscillators in a crystal structure.\n",
