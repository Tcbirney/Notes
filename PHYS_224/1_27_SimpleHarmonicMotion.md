# Harmonic Motion

## Properties

- harmonic motion has to be sonusoidal
- there must be a force tied to the motion

The spring and mass model is a good example.

### Position

> __Remeber Hookes Law: $f = -Kx$__

The force of a spring is a restoring force, which means that it is always trying to restore it to equilibrium.
The force always points towards the equilibrium point, and the displacement points opposite force

>Position is given with $x(t) = Acos(wt)$ where $w$ is in rads/s
>
>But since the position repeats itself every period we can make position a function of time and period, such that
>$$x(t) = x(t + T)$$
>
> Setting each equation equal to each other, we get
>
> $$A \cos (wt) =A \cos (w (t + T)) $$
> $$\cos (wt) = \cos (w(t + T))$$

### Velocity

Velocity oscillates bewteen certain intervals.
Max velocity at equilibrium and zero velocity at turning points. This is because of an exchange of energy between potential and kinetic energy.

>We can derive velocity by taking the derivative of the position. So if position $x(t) = A \cos (wt)$, then velocity $v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -Aw \sin (wt)$
