    "When adding and subtracting complex numbers $\\tilde{z_1}$ and $\\tilde{z_2}$ it is often easier to use cartesian form of the complext numbers. When we add or subtract, all we have to do is combine the real terms, and then combine the imaginary terms. So if\n",

    "### Multiplying and Dividing\n",
    "When multiplying and dividing complex numbers $\\tilde{z_1}$ and $\\tilde{z_2}$ it is often easier to use the polar form of the complex number. All we would need to do is multiply the real component $r$, and then add the $\\theta$ terms in the exponent. So if\n",
