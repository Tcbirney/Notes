If we have a force $F_0$ that does not change with time, then we can say that $w$ and acceleration is 0. We can then derive and equation for x when we have low driving frequencies. \n",

It increases until the resonance frequency is surpasssed and the mass moves in the opposite direction of the driving force. As we increase w the mass once again approaches amplitude 0 since the motion is dominated by the inertia of the block. However, at all frequencies the mass moves up and down periodically at the same frequency as the driving force. This suggests that the displacement can be written as\n",
