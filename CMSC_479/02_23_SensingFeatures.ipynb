    "Raw data is cumbersome. We for images, we get millions of pixels of data. Feature extraction extracts a compressed subset of the data. Features can be a combination of traits derived from mathematical operations performed on our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw Perceptual data required a very robust storage solution, but it provides rich and accurate information. However, it is often less efective to operate on raw data than it is to work on features of raw data.\n",
