## What subsystems are there?

## Sensing

> Where am I?  Whats around me?

There is a sensing actuation loop where the robot only has access to a model of the world. An open loop does not have sensing but a closed loop does.

Robots perceive the world through sensors. We have access to passive and active sensors.

## Actuation

Actuation is when we effect our environment by taking some action on it, such as

- pick and place
- path control
- deploy sensors
- world interaction

### Actuators

- Manipulators
  
  - anchored somewhere
  - industrial
  - operate on an object

- Mobile Robots

  - move around

- Mobile manipulators

  - move and do stuff to an object

For the most part we mean motors and servos

## Control

Different types include

- navigation
- motion planning
- kinematics

## Cognition and Learning

## Interfaces
