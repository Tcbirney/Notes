    "initially we will assign cost of each node to infinity. This allows us to not keep track of visited nodes, because any node which has a cost of infiinity is unvisited. As we explore different branches of the graph, we will only assign to each node the smallest cost to come, and then we will also keep track of which parent node formed the edge of that smallest cost path. Once all mediate next states form a current node are visited, we will close the current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, we are calculating the optimal path to each node. So if the goal node changes to one that we have already determined the shortest path for, we don't need to recalculate the graph. we just need to backtrack from the new goal.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which search strategy should we use? Forwards or Backwards\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on which state is fixed. If the goal node is always ixed, then we can use backwards search to determine the shortest path from the goal node to any other node, which accounts for variable starting locations. Likewise if the starting location is lways guaranteed, then we can use forward search to calculate the shortest path to any other possible goal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra is usefull for dynamc obstacles because we have to implement backwards search. This is because if the obstacle moves during execution, then the robot can be considered to be in a new starting location as well as the obstacle, however the goal node will remain the same. And we would be able to reuse a lot of our generated graph depending on how much the obstacle obscure the old graph.\n"
