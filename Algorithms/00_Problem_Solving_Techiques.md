# Problem Solving techniques

## Divide And Conquer

Usefull for when the task can be divided into two or more smaller, independednt subtasks whc=ich can use a simpler solution each to solve.

## Recursion and Dynamic Programming

Usefull for when the solution state will be applied to a complete, yet smaller subset of the original set

## Case Analysis

Are there different categories of data which can be attributed to the data which can lead to the solution

## Data Structures

Is there a data structure problem which can be directly applied tot he problem. Queues, heaps, stacks, etc

## Iterative Refinement

Formalization of a brute force approach

## Small Examples
Can you find a solution to a small concrete instance of the problem and build a solution which works on any general abstraction of the data

## Reduction

Can you use a problem with aknown solution as a subroutine

## Graph Modelling

Can you describe the problemusing a graph and solve it usuing an existing algorithm

## Write an Equation

Can you express the relationships of the problem in the form of an equation


## Auxilliary Elements

Add a new element to the problem to get closer to the solution

## Variation

Can you solve a spightly different problem and then try to apply it to this problem

## Parallelism

Decompose a problem into subproblems which can be independently solved on different machines

## Caching

Store some computations and look it up later to save computation time

## Symmetry

Is there symmetry in the input space or solution space which can be exploited
