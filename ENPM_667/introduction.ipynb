    "Control Systems can control automated systems like cruise control. In this system we have a desired speed which we set manually. This speed gets compared the desired speed against the actuall speed which results in an error speed. The cruise control system's goal is to reduce the error speed to zero. This usually involves a feedback loop as well.\n",

    "Autopilot is also an example with this excpet the telemetry information was GPS rather than spedometer data\n",
