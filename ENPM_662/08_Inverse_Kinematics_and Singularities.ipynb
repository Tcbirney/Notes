    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wanted to make sure that our robot had 6 degrees of freedom, then it would be a bad idea to just create a long chain of links because each of these joints would have an affect on the position of the end effector, and we would have to redo the inverse kinematics for each joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to have a spherical wrist on the end, then the last 3 joints would have no translational effect on the end effector, only orientational. However, in practice the end effector would always have some offest from the center of the spherical wrist, thus giving the shperical joint some effect on the position of the end effector.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we can solve for the position and orientation of the robot assuming that the d offset of the tool frame from the spheriacal wrist is 0, and then by recorrecting assuming that we have some actual physical offset.\n",
