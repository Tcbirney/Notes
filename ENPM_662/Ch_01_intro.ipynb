    "\n",
    "An object is said to have n degrees of freedom if its configuration can be minimally defined in n paramters. The number of DOFs does not necessarily depend on the number of joints because there may be reduntant joints that do not provide extra degrees of freedom.\n",

    "A rigid object in 3d space must be dfined by 6 DOFs. X, Y and Z for positioning, and roll, pitch, and yaw for orientation.\n",

    "The __Manipulator State__, on the other hand, when combined with the manipulators dynamics and input, can determine any future state of the manipulator. And the __State Space__ is the set of all possible states. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of a manipulator arm, the dynamics are newtonian and can be generalized with $F=ma$. And we would be able to represent the state of a joint as $x = (q_i, \\dot{q_i})^T$ where $q$ is the value of the joint and $\\dot{q}$ is the inear or angular velocity of said joint. Acceleration can be derived programmatically by taking the difference of the velocity over time. The size of the state space is usually $2n$ where the system has $n$ DOFs.\n",

    "- Geometry\n",
    "    - The geometry of a manipulator is normally characterized by the types of the first 3 joints of the arm. They usually fall into these 5 categories\n",

    "        - Spherical (RRP)\n",

    "- Intended Application Area\n",
    "    - Broken into assembly and non assembly robots. Assembly robots are small electrically driven and either revoulte or SCARA in design.\n",
    "- Method of Control\n",
    "    - Broken into servo and non servo robots. Early robots were non servo ad open  loop devices whose movement is limited to predetermined mechanical stops. Servo bots use closed loop computer controls to determine their motion\n",
    "        - Servo robots are further classified by the method they use to guide the end affector, those being __point to point__ and __continous path__ robots. Point to point robots can be taught a discrete set of points but there is no control on the path the robot takes in between the taught points. Continous path robots have a fully controllable path for the end affector. These are the most advanced.\n",
