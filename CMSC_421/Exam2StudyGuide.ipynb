    "- Asymmetric Keys are used to exchange symmetric keys\n",
    "- Each user has a public and private key, sender encrypts message using recipients private key, and then the recipient decrypts the message using their own private key\n",

    "## Signals, interrupts, and traps\n",
    "- signals come from software, interrupts come from hardware\n",
    "- polling is when we check intermitently if decived need servicing, interrupts send data to an interruot register and are checked after every intruction\n",
    "- signals are the software equivalent to hardware interrupts like ctrl+c\n",

    "## Scheduling and Dispatching\n",
    "- Scheduling is choosing which job comes next, dispatching gets job from scheduler, and dispatcher puts it in running queue\n",

    "- Criteria for Scheduling\n",
    "first come first serve, shortest job first, shortest remaining time first\n",
