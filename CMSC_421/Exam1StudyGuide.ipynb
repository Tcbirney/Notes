    "# Study Guide Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## OS Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "What does a system call do\n",
    "- goes form user land to kernel land. How you access kernel resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a system program\n",
    "- ls, find, which, grep. Things that are tied to the OS\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the imporance of having libraries\n",
    "- prgorammers ar lazy. there are plenty of people smarter than me writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between A cpu and a core of a cpu.\n",
    "- A CPU is a physical unit. A cpu can have multiple cores, which execute instructions in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a process. Define a process and a program\n",
    "- A process is a task that is running in an operating system. A program is dormant, while a process is active\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand stack, heap, data, text sections of virtual memory\n",
    "- Each process has virtual memory. Stack is for stoting parameters or recursion. HEaps are for allocating dynamic memory. Data section is or storing variables. Text is for storing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which states can a process reside in\n",
    "- State table. new, ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a proces control block\n",
    "- a table storign all metadat about a process. Used as a bookwmakr when the os needs to save state progress and switch to another state.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a contexts switch\n",
    "- When we switch processes using the process control block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diff between fork exec and Waiting\n",
    "- fork duplicates process, exec replaces child process, wait has parent wait for chils to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many process are running when you fork a process\n",
    "- 2. 2^n are created. 2^n - 1 have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a thread vs process\n",
    "Threads share address space. Process have their own virtual memory. Threads therefore require more careful programming as to not contaiminate eachothers data. Threads require less resources as well. Data is allocated on the stack since we are sharing all other sections of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process ID\n",
    "- ID of the running process. Can find with ps -ef\n",
    "\n",
    "State Tables\n",
    "- same thing as the process states, no skipping steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between a zombie and an orphan.\n",
    "-Zombie process are doing no work but havent been terminated, parent is dead. Orphanned processes have not been retireved by the parent. Orphaned proceeses will go up the family tree to next of kin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared memory vs messgae message passing\n",
    "- Shared memory has 2 processes using a buffer in user land writing and reading data fo and from each otehr. Requires synchronization between processes. Message passing has a queue in kernel land where programs can read and write when they are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocking vs Non Blocking:\n",
    "- some processes need to be finished before they allow other processes to continue. Like when a pipe is full and we want to send data strough it still. lucy and the chocolate factory\n",
    "\n",
    "Interprocess communication\n",
    "- Many programms require the aide of others to function. \n",
    "\n",
    "##How are pipes used\n",
    "\n",
    "Te producer consumer problem\n",
    "- Lucy and the chocolate factory problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicore vs multiprocessor\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multicore,more than one core, with parallelism. Multiprocessing is concurrency with time slicing in the off time. Can be done on a s single core machine\n",
    "\n",
    "What is hyper Threading\n",
    "- when cores have their own sets of register for one core. Each core can still only do one process per unit of time, but we can change proceses very quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal Handling\n",
    "- NOT ON THE EXAM\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between layers of cache\n",
    "- The higher the cache level, the more valueable the data, the quicker and smaller the cache cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency vs parallelism\n",
    "- parallelism means processes are being executed in the same exact time. Parallelism is like multi core or multithreading processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a thread pool.\n",
    "NOT ON EXAM\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahmdals Law\n",
    "Speed up with parallel and serial processes\n",
    "\n",
    "\\proc\n",
    "Virtual mounted filesystem that contains data about processes."
