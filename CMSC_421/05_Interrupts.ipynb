    "Interrupts are external events that causes a change in the normal execution of the intruction execution and are usually genrerated by hardware devices. Interrupts are asynchronous with respect to the current process. The process can not determine when the next interrupt will happem.\n",

    "- We want to get the CPUs attention\n",
    "- around 150 programs each need processing power\n",

    "\n",
    "But we can't predict when devices need CPU service, so they must be asynchronous. But we want to make sure the CPU stays busy.\n",
